This project implements a simple database management system with B+ tree indexing for handling student records. 
Each student record contains last name, first name and a confidential information field. 

The program is able to:
1. INSERT new student records into a possibly empty table;
2. SEARCH for the record of a given student and print it out;
3. LIST all students names in the appropriate order;
4. UPDATE a given student record;
5. DELETE a given student record;
6. SNAPSHOT: 
    - print the number of records in the table; 
    - print the depth of the B+ tree;
    - print the first and last key of all the B+ tree nodes.
